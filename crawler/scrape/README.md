This scrape is modified based on https://github.com/Jefferson-Henrique/GetOldTweets-python

The modified we have:
1. Foe our project want to search tweets with hash tag: Brexit (and others)
2. Now the code support multiple processes
3. Now support resume and stop at breakpoints with losing integrity
4. If server stop provide service (visit too many times, and like that), it will sleep and    restart automaticall

You could set the month and hashtag you want to in main
